# Taskrunner

## Aims

This application will connect to the Taskqueue and run tasks from it on local machines. It will contain versioned proceedures to be performed allowing reproducibility and an audit trail on what code has been run on what data.

## Initial release

The first proceedure for Taskrunner will be an OpenMM molecular dynamics simulation on a solvated molecule.
